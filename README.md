# Automatic Hanoi Tower Solver 3D Interface

This project is a Tower of Hanoi solver with an interactive 3D visualization. It uses a Python Flask backend to calculate the moves and a JavaScript/HTML frontend to render the puzzle in 3D. The solver automates the process of solving the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, allowing users to visualize the solution step-by-step.

## Features

- **Automatic Solver**: Computes the optimal sequence of moves to solve the Tower of Hanoi for any number of disks.
- **3D Visualization**: Displays an interactive 3D representation of the Tower of Hanoi using JavaScript and HTML.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Allows users to specify the number of disks to solve.
- **Responsive UI**: Runs seamlessly in modern web browsers.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Flask for server-side logic, managing the solver algorithm, and serving the 3D visualization.
- **Frontend**: HTML and JavaScript for the user interface, complemented by Three.js for 3D rendering capabilities.
